CSE 330S Nikki Wines - Fall Semester 2016

Module 2: This assignment involves creating and configuring a cloud instance, installing Apache and related software, and then making a simple file sharing site.

Module 3: The assignment has two sections. The first part involves running MySQL queries by hand and running them through phpMyAdmin. The second part involves creating a news site that allows for users to save their information, add/delete users, create/delete/edit stories, and comment on those stories.

Module 4: This assignment involves learning the fundamentals of Python, and using regular expressions to run a matching program on a set of statistics.

Module 5: This assignment involves learning JavaScript to create several web applications: A JavaScript calculator, a weather widget, and a JavaScript calendar that allow users to add/edit/save events dynamically.

Module 6: This assignment builds upon the JavaScript taught in Module 5, and involves creating a static file server in Node.JS, as well as creating a multi-room chat server using Node.JS that allows users to create, join and even ban users from dynamically created chat rooms.

Module 7: This assignment introduces us to Angular JS to create a quick and efficient front-end coffee rating website that allows users to view comments and images from a database.

Module 8 (Final Project): Our final project was an assignment of our choice, with the caveat that we had to implement a new framework that hadn't been taught in class. I chose to use PHP Laravel and to create a simple social media site (similar to Facebook). This project involved storing user information in the backend using SQL and displaying it in the front end using Angular. The final social media site allowed users to dynamically create/delete users, edit user information, create their personal profile page, post on people's walls, comment on those posts, and even recover their emails through a support email system.
