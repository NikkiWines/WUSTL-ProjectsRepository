CSE438S Nikki Wines - Spring Semester 2017

Lab 1: In this lab, I created a simple shopping calculator.

Lab 2: In this lab, I created an app to take care of a series of virtual pets.

Lab 3: In this lab, I used UIKit and Core Graphics to create  a simple
drawing app.

Lab 4: In this lab, I created a movie selection app that uses tabs and navigation bars to allow for three pages: First, a page that allows you to search a database for a specific movie. Second, a detailed page that shows the movies rating, name, and other information. And lastly, a favorites page, where you can add a delete movies. The app stores the favorites information between uses (WIP).
