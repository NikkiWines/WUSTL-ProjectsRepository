CSE438S Nikki Wines - Spring Semester 2017

Lab 1: In this lab, I created a simple shopping calculator.

Lab 2: In this lab, I created an app to take care of a series of virtual pets.

Lab 3: In this lab, I used UIKit and Core Graphics to create  a simple
drawing app.

Lab 4: In this lab, I created a movie selection app that uses tabs and navigation bars to allow for three pages: First, a page that allows you to search a database for a specific movie. Second, a detailed page that shows the movies rating, name, and other information. And lastly, a favorites page, where you can add a delete movies. The app stores the favorites information between uses.

Lab 5: In this lab, I adapted the virtual pets app, adding a watch iOS extension. The watch app communicates in real time with the iPhone app. You can feed or play with your pet from your watch, and have it update live on your phone. You can also make each pet play a sound, and switch between pets dynamically with swiping. 

Final Project (WIP) : For this final project, my team and I are building a multi-user bucket list application, using Firebase as the backend. The user can create public or private bucket list items, add other users' public bucket list items to their list, and upvote bucket list items that they think are interesting. The user will be able to search (using, most likely, the yelp API) for activites in their area to add to their bucket list. Ideally, the app will be useful for both a single user, and for a large group of users. Possible extensions to this app include adding comments, location based user filtering (show top items near you) filtering items by tags, implementing stickers, themes, and possibly achievements/points for completion.
