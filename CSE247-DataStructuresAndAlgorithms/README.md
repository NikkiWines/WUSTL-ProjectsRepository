CSE 247 Nikki Wines - Fall Semester 2016

Lab 1 (folder: heaps): This assignment involves implementing a binary heap data structure and a minimum priority queue data structure to further understand the details of implementing a binary tree, and how a binary tree is implemented in an array.

Lab 2 (folder: spaths): This assignment involves building an implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm based on our binary heap from Lab 1.

Lab 3 (folder: kwaymergesort): This assignment involves implementing a merge sort function that sorts K sub-collections rather than the standard 2 sub-collections.

Lab 4 (folder: rabinkarp): This assignment involves applying a hashing scheme in pursuit of finding occurrences of one string in another, using the Rabin-Karp Algorithm.

Lab 5 (folder: dh): This assignment involves implementation of a caesar cypher to create a unbreakable encryption scheme in the form of a one-time pad.
