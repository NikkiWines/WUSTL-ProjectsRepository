Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Part A

What do you see in the plots for ticks and time?

They appear to grow quadratically though the time curve is less smooth than the ticks curve. 

How would you characterize those curves?

As quadratic curves

Based on the current code for addLast, why do you see this behavior?

Because there is a single for loop in AddLastBase and then an additional for loop in AddLastNoTail. AddLastNoTail calls AddLast base- making the entire equation hold a nested for loop, which produces quadratic equations. 
Part B

What behavior do you see now for appending n items to a list if you use a tail reference?

The time is constant

While we have reasoned so far only about time, if we are adding n elements to the end of a list, what is the asymptotic complexity of the additional space required when using the tail reference?

Theta(1)

Under what conditions would you recommend using a linked list with a tail reference vs. a linked list without at tail reference?

Using a linked list with the tail will cause the program to run faster. 

Part C

Why does getSize() take the time it does?

Because ticker.tick is within the for loop- making it a linear output.

How did you achieve Î˜(1) performance for getSize()?

Counted the values as they were added, rather than counting the list- created new variable count to measure it. 


Move ticker.tick() from within the for loop in getSize() and put it at the end
