function moles= nmoles(mass, molarWeight)

%This function takes in the values for [mass] and [molarWeight]
%and computes the number of moles for the mass based off of the inputs.
%INPUTS:
%mass-- vector input 
%molarWeight-- vector input
%OUTPUTS:
%moles-- matrix output as a function of the vectors mass and molarWeight

[X, Y] = meshgrid(mass, molarWeight);

moles= X./Y;
