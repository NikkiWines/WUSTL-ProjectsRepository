%Problem 1: This problem involves using cell arrays to store and compute 
%information about a group of elements-- work is stored in the
%metals_cell.m script.

metals_cell

%Problem 2: This problem involves using structures rather than cell arrays
%to store and compute information about a group of elements-- information
%is stored in the metals_struct.m script. 

metals_struct

%Problem 3: This problem involves the user inputting the psuedo code used
%for problems 5 and 6 

% The first element in the series is one: y(1)=1 
% for i=1:max_it solve for the next term in the series and add it to the
% previous terms. 
% if the criterion for convergence is met, break out of the loop 
% end loop 
% return the last element which should be the sum of all the terms computed
% in the for loop up from the second element up to the value detailed by max_it. 

%Problem 4: This problem was completed during the lab section: it involved
%creating a flow chart outlining the processes used for problems 5 and 6. 

%Problem 5: This problem involves creating a function that computes an
%approximation of cos(x) when given x, the maximum number of iterations,
%and the criterion for convergence.

my_cos(2,10,0.0001)

my_cos(2,5,0.0001)

%Problem 6: This problem involves changing the midpoint break for loop used
%in the previous problem to a midpoint break while loop. 

my_cos2(2,10,0.0001)

my_cos2(2,5,0.0001)
