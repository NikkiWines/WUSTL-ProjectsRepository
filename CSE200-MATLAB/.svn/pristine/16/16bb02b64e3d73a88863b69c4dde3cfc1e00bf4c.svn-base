%Problem 1: This problem asks the user to guess a value between 1 and 10
%and has computer present the number guesses it took to get the value
%right.

guesses= guessingGame()


%Problem 2: This problem involves computing a number of games of rock paper
%scissors and having the command window display the result of the game.

z=rockPaperScissors()

%Problem 3: This problem involves bringing up a menu of previously made
%games and allowing the user to play the game that is selected.

gameMenu()

%Problem 4: This problem involves recursively taking the factorial of the odd values
%from one to the input value.

oddFactR(5)

oddFactR(6)

oddFactR(9)

%Probelm 5: This problem involves taking in a value N and returning the
%Fibonacci sequence from 0 to N.

fibR(5)

fibR(9)

fibR(2)

%Problem 6: This probelm involes taking in a vector and a scalar value and
%returning true if the scalar value is contained inside the vector.

x = containsI(1:10, 7)

x = containsI(1:10, -5)

x = containsI([9 -2 4 -15 7], -15)

x = containsI([], -15)

%Problem 7: This function involves taking in a vector and a scalar value
%and returning true if the scalar value is contained inside the vector.
%However, this time the function must be recursive.

x = containsR(1:10, 7)

x = containsR(1:10, -5)

x = containsR([9 -2 4 -15 7], -15)

x = containsR([], -15)
