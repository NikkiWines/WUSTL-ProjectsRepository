%Problem 1: This problem involves taking in input n and outputting the
%factorial of n; !n. 

myFactorial(4) 
f= factorial(4) 

%Problem 2: This problem involves taking in a value n and creating a pascal
%matrix from that value. 
pascalMatrix(3) 

pascalMatrix(4)

%Problem 3: This is a problem that is similar to a studio problem called
%futureValue, it takes in 3 inputs; an investment rate, an interest rate
%and a number of periods. However, this problem involves creating a vector
%showing the values for each period. 

futureValueLoop(1500,.03,5)

futureValueLoop(10000,.08,10)

%Problem 4: This problem takes in a vector of values and returns both the
%smallest value and the index of occurence of the smallest value.
  
[x y] = myMin([8 1 10 -5 11])

[x y] = myMin([11 -2 5 17 12 -2])

[x y] = myMin ([])

%Problem 5: This problem asks the user to take 2 scalar values and compute
%all of the prime numbers between those values as a vector

myPrime(17,35) 

myPrime(1,15) 

myPrime(225,241)

%Problem 6: This problem involves computing the square root of p in
%iterations

sqrtTolerance(100,.0001) 

sqrtTolerance(50,.0001)

%Problem 7: This problem involes computing the number of temperatures 
%greater than a single value T and giving the indexes of the temperatures 

[n i] = tempCheck([99 88 84 77 92 95 100 101 96], 95)

[n i] = tempCheck([84 84 77 76 67 71 82 85], 95)

%Problem 8: This problem is the same as problem 7, but the user is allowed
%to use loops to compute the answer. 

[n i] = tempCheckLoop([99 88 84 77 92 95 100 101 96], 95)

[n i] = tempCheckLoop([84 84 77 76 67 71 82 85], 95)

%I prefer the non loop method because it uses far fewer lines of code and
%is simpler to understand. It is a clear more concise method.
