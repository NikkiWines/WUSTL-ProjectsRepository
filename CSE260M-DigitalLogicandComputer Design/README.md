CSE260M Nikki Wines - Fall Semester 2017

Lab 1: In this assignment I created a 4-bit binary-to-decimal decoder on the NEXYS 4 using VHDL 

Lab 2: In this assignment I modeled a single process different engine that stops after reaching the maximum value of the polynomial f(x) = 1,000,000x + x2 + x3 – x4 for x =0, 1, 2, …. I also added a multiplexor that connected to 16 LEDs, turning on or off with either the lower (switch 0 = 0) or the upper (switch 0 = 1) 16 bits of the maximum 32-bit value produced by the difference engine

Lab 3: In this assignment I adapted Lab 2 with a partial bus-based difference engine. We created a Mealy-model FSM to compelte the basic design of the FSM and then modeled the difference engine in VHDL, again adding in the multiplexor to drive the LEDs.
