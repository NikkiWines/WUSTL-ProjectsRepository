CSE231S Nikki Wines - Spring Semester 2017

HW1: This assignment involves writing sequential and parallel code to count nucleobases in a human X chromosome.

HW2: This assignment involves manipulating an image to change a target color into a replacement color. This “flood fill” algorithm is similar to the one used in the Photoshop “paint bucket” tool; it finds a group of interconnected pixels of the same color and fills them with a new color.

HW3: This assignment involves writing sequential and parallel code to solve the N-Queens problem using backtrack recursion.

HW4: This assignment involves implementing map reduce function for a friends-of-friends social situation. 

HW5: This assignment involves using threads and frameworks to impelement sequential, divide-and-conquer, and parallel versions of nucleobase counting methods and quicksort. Additionally, I created async and finish constructs, first using threads, and then using frameworks.
