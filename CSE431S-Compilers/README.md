CSE431 Nikki Wines - Spring Semester 2017

Lab 1: In this assignment I implemented a simple finite-state transducer, which uses the actions of a finite-state automaton to perform a simple language translation.

Lab 2: In this assignment I implemented a simple expression evaluator using recursive-descent parsing.

Lab 3: In this assignment I implemented a bottom-up parser and analyzed the structure of the Java programming language by constructing abstract syntax trees (WIP).
