CSE131-Final Project Nikki Wines - Fall Semester 2015

Project Description:
Single-player remake of the online game Agar.io. In Agar.io players control a cell in a large map representing a petri dish. As the cell consumers smaller cells, it gains mass. If the cell comes in contact with larger cells, it will lose mass. The goal of the game is to gain as much mass as possible. }
