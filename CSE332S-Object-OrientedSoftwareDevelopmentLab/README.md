CSE332 Nikki Wines - Spring Semester 2017

Lab 0: This lab implemented basic C++ program structure, data movement and execution control concepts, including:
        -C++ header files and C++ source files;
        -C++ STL string, input, and output streams;
        -C++ precompiler directives; and
        -basic C++ data types (including enumerations and C++ style strings).
Lab 1: This lab extended the basic C++ language features from the previous lab, implemented additional features including:
        -declaring a struct to represent game pieces (e.g., for games like chess and checkers),
        -using file streams and string streams to import information into a program,
        -and subscripting (indexing) into a vector representing the positions of pieces on a game board.

Lab 2:  This lab involved creating a working Nine Almonds game using C++. The user can input coordinates and move their piece (denoted by an A) over an almond and into an empty location. The game also checks for stalemates, and regects incorrect moves. This lab extended my experience using object-oriented programming techniques in C++, including:
        -encapusulating game data within a class,
        -prompting for and receiving user input for game moves,
        -determining whether or not a move is valid, and if it is
        -updating and displaying the new state of the game.


Lab 3: This lab extended the NineAlmonds game from Lab 2, adding a new Magic Square game. The user could choose from a set of numbers, and place them on the board using coordinates. This game also checked for stalemates. In addition to this, we also implemented a variable for game board size, and starting location for the set of numbers. A user could change their standard 3x3 board and 0-9 set of numbers to any board greater than or equal to 1x1 and any starting number (positive or negative). This lab implemented programming techniques such as: 
        -refactoring common data structures and behaviors into a base class, and
        -specializing how the common parts are used in different derived classes.
